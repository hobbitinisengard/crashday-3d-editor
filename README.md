# 3D editor for Crashday
It's an improved version of map editor built in a classic arcade racing game - Crashday released in 2006. The project which was initially started for the sole purpose of simplifying precise terrain forming for tracks, over time enabled to use legacy and hidden features of TRK track file format extending mapping possibilities.
